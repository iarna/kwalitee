# kwalitee

This package is designed to give a community biased and opinionated metric to packages on npm.

Over time, the community has built up a series of best practices in regards to what constitutes great packages on npm. As
a lot of these are unknown to new comers, or even old comers who aren't in the know; this tool should provide them with
a great way in which to incrementally improve their package for wider use.

This module is *EXPECTED* to change over time, with new metrics, improved metrics and even complete reversal on metrics
that may be considered bad in future.

The hope is that this information will be used by the npm registry directly so that the "_kwalitee_" metric can be 
tracked over time and improve with community involvement.

If you have more questions or want to have a look at requested metrics, please have a look at this repos 
[issues](https://github.com/konobi/kwalitee/issues)
